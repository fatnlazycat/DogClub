!!!!! Please run the program in the same folder whith the file doglist.txt !!!!!


A small tool for accounting members of a certain organization.
A canine club was taken as an example.
The program maintains data about the dog & its master as well as some basic operations: insertion & exclusion of members.
The main idea was to show the developer's ability for creation of simple code.
Further versions will provide some extra functionality.
Yours, Dmitriy Kosyakov.
